### Code Contribution
This section is to help developers set up Siteit locally on their machines for development.

#### Getting Started

##### Pre-requisites

Make sure you have the following technologies installed on your machine:
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)current LTS version.
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm#use-npm-to---) current release.

An easy to way to test if you already have the above technologies installed is by running the following commands:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
If you have `node` and `npm` installed, the above commands will print the installed `version` information.

_If you get an error message, please install the missing technology._

**Note**:
We recommend installing the current LTS version of [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for your operating system to test and develop Siteit without complications.

#### Getting Started
- [`fork`](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the Siteit on Github.
- Use `git clone` to `clone` the forked repo to your local machine
- `cd` into the cloned directory, and create a new `branch` for your changes.
- Run `npm link` to run Siteit locally on your machine
- Run `npm start` to start Siteit

##### About `npm start`
This script builds the source code using `babel`, and starts an instance of `siteit` on your machine.

#### Making Changes
*Note:*
- Make all your changes in a new `git` `branch`. Learn more about creating branches [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging)
- Make changes only in the `src` folder

To run Siteit locally with changes you introduced to the source code, you need to run the following script:
```bash
npm run build
```
Running the above script will compile the code using `babel` and output in the `build` folder.

_Modify the files in `src` folder, as files within the `build` folder are overwritten when the source code is compiled using `babel`._

##### Starting the Project
 Assuming you ran the `npm link` previously as instructed, run `npm start` to start Siteit locally. Alternatively, you can start the project by running `node ./build/index.js` from the command line.

##### Statically Generated Content
If you ran the tool using options that accepts a `source` as an `argument`, the rendered HTML will can be found in the `dist` under `root`.

#### Formatting and Error Checking
Frequently check your code for formatting and other problems using the following commands:

`npm run prettier:check`
Running the above script will run tests to check for formatting errors in the `src` folder, using `prettier`.

`npm run lint`
Running the above script will run tests to check for problems in the code using `ESLint`.

---

To automatically apply the changes detected by using `prettier` and `ESLint`, use the following scripts:

```bash
npm run prettier:format
npm run lint:fix
```

---

**Note:**
If you push changes without running checks for formatting and problems in code, the `husky` `pre-commit` `hook` will automatically apply the changes before pushing your changes remotely to GitHub.

#### Running Tests
Siteit currently supports initial testing for functionality using the Jest framework.

To run tests using `jest`, execute the following `script`:
 ```bash
 npm test
 ```
